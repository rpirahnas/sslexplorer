/**
 * Extension to the standard struts {@link org.apache.struts.action.ActionForm}
 * that adds some additional attributes used by pretty much all of
 * SSL-Explorer's forms.
 * <p>
 * One such attribute is the <i>Referer</i> attribute. This should be set when
 * entering a form for the first in some kind of flow (edit screen for example).
 * When the form is finished with (e.g. when the user commits the entered
 * details or cancels the form) the browser is forwarded to the stored referer.
 * This allows us to return to the page the flow was called from.
 * <p>
 * Another command attribute is the <i>Action Target</i>. This is used by all
 * <i>Dispatch Actions</i> to store action withing the dispatch action to
 * invoke on the next execution.
 * <p>
 * <i>Editing</i> is another common attribute to be used to denote the form is
 * editing an entity as opposed to creating it.
