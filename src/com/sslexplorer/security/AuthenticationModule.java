/**
 * Interface to be implemented to provide a single <i>Authentication Modules</i>.
 * <p>
 * Authentication modules provide the logic and the user interface for a single
 * stage in an <i>Authentication Scheme</i> that a user must complete to 
 * be able to logon on use SSL-Explorer's services.
 * <p>
 * Each module must have an {@link com.sslexplorer.security.AuthenticationModuleDefinition}
 * that must be registed with the {@link com.sslexplorer.security.AuthenticationModuleManager}.
 * <p>
 * When authentication is required by the module, the first thing that happens
 * is all of the modules in the scheme are initialised by called their {@link #init(AuthenticationScheme)}
 * methods. 
 * <p>
 * When it is this schemes turn, the {@link #authenticate(HttpServletRequest, RequestParameterMap)}
 * method will be called expecting either a {@link com.sslexplorer.security.Credentials}
 * object or any exception to be thrown if the authentication failed.
 * <p>
 * If applicable, each module must return the page to a JSP page that provides
 * the web based user interface for the module.
 * <p>
 * A module may be capable of supporting the entering of a username, in which
 * case it is known as a <i>Primary Authentication Modules</i>. If this 
 * capability is not available, the module is a <i>Secondary Authentication Module</i>
 * and may only be used after a primary has already been used.
 * <p>
 * There is a third type called a <i>System Authentication Module</i> which is
 * used interally by the SSL-Explorer or its plugins but never presented to
 * user directly. These are currently used for Webdav and Embedded client
 * logons.
