 * WebDav client) is allowed access.
 * <p>
 * Each restrictions consists of an <i>Address Pattern</i> that may
 * either be :-
 * <ul>
 * <li>A fully qualified IPV4 address. E.g. 192.168.1.10 would only match when
 * this exact IP address attempts access.</li>
 * <li>A wildcard address. E.g. 192.168.1.* would match any host from the
 * 192.168.1 subnet.</li>
 * <ul>
 * <p>
 * Ip restrictions may either be <i>Allow</i> restrictions or <i>Deny</i>
 * restrictions. 
 * <p>
 * Ip restrictions have a <i>Priority</i> which determines the order in
 * which the are processed.
