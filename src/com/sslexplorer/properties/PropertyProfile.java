 * All property values are held in a profile. Profiles provide a way of of the
 * user selecting a set of property values depending on the environment they are
 * in. For example, there may be a profile configured whose properties are
 * appropriate for using when a user is connecting via the Office Lan. The
 * administrator may also have configured a second profile who property values
 * are more appropriate when users are connecting from somewhere less secure,
 * such as an Internet Cafe.
 * <p>
 * There are two types of profile, <b>Global</b>, and <b>Personal</b>. Global
 * profiles are created by an administrator and then assigned to users via
 * policies. Many users may share the same profile. Personal profiles are
 * created by users themselves and are only usable by them.
 * <p>
 * Only property definitions that have a visibility of
 * {@link com.sslexplorer.boot.PropertyDefinition#PROFILE} may exist in global
 * or personal profiles.
 * <p>
 * There also exists a special <b>Default</b> global profile. This profile has
 * an id of 0 and is also used store to the default global profile <strong>and</strong>
 * system configuration <strong>and</strong> hidden properties.
