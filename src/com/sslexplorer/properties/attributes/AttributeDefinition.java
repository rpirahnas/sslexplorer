/**
 * Extension of the default {@link com.sslexplorer.boot.PropertyDefinition}
 * implementation, instances of which may be created and maintained by the
 * administrator to provide details for <i>Attributes</i>.
 * <p>
 * An attribute definition may have one of
 * 4 visibilities. This may be one of {@link #USER_OVERRIDABLE_ATTRIBUTE},
 * {@link #USER_VIEWABLE_ATTRIBUTE}, {@link #USER_USEABLE_ATTRIBUTE} or
 * {@link #USER_CONFIDENTIAL_ATTRIBUTE}.
 * <p>
 * <i>User Confidential attributes</i> are encrypted using the users
 * private key. See {@link com.sslexplorer.security.PublicKeyStore}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Attribute definitions may be registered without being stored to the
 * database by using
 * {@link PropertyClass#registerPropertyDefinition(PropertyDefinition)} via 
 * {@link PropertyClassManager#getPropertyClass(String)}.
 * <p>
 * This is useful for plugins who may wish to attribute definitions without the
 * user having to configure them. Such definitions cannot be edited or removed
 * and should be marked as <i>System</i>.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the capabilities of a property definition, attribute
 * definitions also require a label. Attributes registered as <i>System</i> may
 * provide message resources that will be used in preference to the label field
 * this class supports. This requires that the bundle ID has also been supplied.
 * Message resources for labels should be specified as 
 * <i>userAttribte.[name].title</i>.
 * <p>
 * In the same way as labels, descriptions may also be supplied. This requires 
 * that the bundle ID has also been supplied and a message resource specified as 
 * <i>userAttribte.[name].description</i> exists.
 * <p>
 * Definitions may be categorised in one of two ways. Either a category ID that
 * is a registered {@link com.sslexplorer.boot.PropertyDefinitionCategory}
 * may be supplied, or a simple text label. The former is most likely to be used
 * by attribute definitions registered by the core and plugins, the later for
 * user defined definitions.
 * <p>
 * Attributes also have a <i>replaceable</i> attribute that determines if
 * they may be used as replacement variables for attributes of the various
 * different resource types.   
 * 
 * @see com.sslexplorer.security.UserDatabase
