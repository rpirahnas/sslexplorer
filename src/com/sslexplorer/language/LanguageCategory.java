 * Encapsulates an I18N category. A single category maps to a single
 * resources file in a particular name space. For example, the resource
 * /com/sslexplorer/agent/ApplicationResources.properties maps to the category
 * with the ID of <i>com.sslexplorer.agent</i>.
 * <p>
 * Each category must provide have an ID as a dotted namespace,
 * the base URL the resource came from (i.e. the jar or directory
 * URL), a path for the resource inside the base resource, a name   
 * description and location.
 * <p>
 * The name and description elements will be in <b>English</b> as they
 * are loaded from the default English translation that is included with
 * the core. If you need localised category names you will have to 
 * retrieve then yourself from the appropriate message bundle.  
 * <p>
 * The location determines what component of SSL-Explorer the 
 * category is used in. It may currently be one of 
 * {@link #LOCATION_CORE}, {@link #LOCATION_AGENT} or 
 * {@link #LOCATION_LAUNCHER}.
 * <p>
 * The categories available are determined by scanning the
 * classpath for all default english ApplicationResources.properties 
 * resources. Use {@link LanguagePackManager#getCategories()} to retrieve
 * this list of all available categories.
