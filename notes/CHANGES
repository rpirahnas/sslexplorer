Community Edition 

Features
    o Delegation � Assign rights to your users that allow them access to management console functions.
    o Multiplexed Agent � The agent has been re-factored to multiplex all communication over a single 
      connection. The previous implementation maintained separate connections for each tunnel opened 
      and lacked interactive communication with the SSL-Explorer server.
    o SWT Agent � A new GUI has been introduced for Java 1.4+ that uses native platform components using 
      Eclipses SWT technology. 
    o Options Panel � A new toggle side panel has been introduced to allow various options to be configured. 
      These options include language, profile and the option to hide layout components such as the menu, 
      warnings, information messages etc
    o Logon Page � An authentication banner can now be added to the logon page with options to change text
      and add a company logo. All versioning information has been removed from unauthenticated pages. 
    o Disable Extensions � Extensions can now be disabled rather than removed.
    o Application Shortcut Parameters � parameter entry can now be validated.
    o Attribute Validation � information can now be added to custom attributes to enforce that users enter 
      a valid value for a given attribute.
    o Policy Attributes � Attributes can now be configured on policy objects that allow customization of a 
      resource through policy attributes.
    o Launch Resource By Policy � Resources can now be launched via a specific policy (required for Policy 
      attributes)

      to help prevent users from locking themselves out of the system.
    o Network Places � Creation of network places made simpler to allow selection of file type.
    o Icon View � Added to all resources including favorites page.
    o Agent Cleanup � An additional option has been added to cleanup the agent when the user logs out. This 
      removes all trace of the agent from the client machine.

      issues in GSS-API implementation. SSL support added to secure simple binding authentication (SSL is not
      compatible with GSS-API)

      
Bug Fixes
    o Improved Page Loading � Previous versions of SSL-Explorer suffered from a larger than normal CSS file

      unauthenticated users. This was only possible within a short period of time whilst the
      session cookie was still valid. 
    o Network place file store does not accept linux native paths.

-----------------

SSL-Explorer 0.2.8_01 - September 29, 2006

Bug Fixes
    o Web Folders fails if server is installed with a non-english locale. 
    o Source distribution fails when attempt is made to launch install wizard.

-----------------

SSL-Explorer 0.2.8  - September 25, 2006

Features
    o Completion of authentication scheme flow changes introduced over last few 
      releases. All schemes are now assigned via policy. Checks have been added
      to ensure that the Super User does not lock themselves out of the system 
      through changes to authentication schemes and/or policies.
    o Restrict resource access to signed on policy added. If this option is 
      enabled in the System Configuration then a user will only have access 
      to resources attached to policies that were also attached to the 
      authentication scheme they signed in with.
    o Improved and expanded Agent message notifications. Popups will now be
      displayed on startup / shutdown, when tunnels are opened, 
      applications are launched and more.
    o Tidied up Agent debug console.
    o Added new 'Last data' column to Agent tunnel monitor that shows the time
      data last travelled through a tunnel.       
    o New 'server' and 'javas' extension types added to support execution of native
      and Java applications directly on the server. 
    o Disabled cookies are now detected and an information page is displayed 
      requesting that the user re-enable them.
    o Active Directory OU filter now supports OU exclusion.
                  
Bug Fixes
    o Active DNS hostname format setting added to Web Forward resource settings.
      This allows the option to have Active DNS hostnames generated as a child
      domain of the SSL-Explorer server or on the same domain.
    o Authentication scheme cannot be selected using the Return/Enter key 
      during logon.
    o RSS feeds do not display the first time a page is accessed.
    o Fixed problem with embedded client enabled applications not working the 
      first they are launched. This was caused by incorrect case in the 
      authentication HTTP headers. 
    o XMLHttpRequests no longer defeat the session timeout. A symptom of 
      this problem was when you have the Mail Check extension installed, 
      a login would never timeout regardless of user activity. This 
      required changes to Jetty.
    o Fixed JavaScript errors on account edit page, edit authentication scheme 
      page and user attributes page. 
    o Fixed height tab problems on a number of pages.
    o Fixed some harmless exceptions that would occur when the Agent
      tunnel monitor is running.
    o Fixed margins / style problem in network place file system view page.
    o Fixed problem in IE where the Agent would sometimes not 
      redirect the browser to the correct page after a tunnel or application
      launch.

    o RSS feeds can now be shown everytwhere except in User Console.
    o Removed stray debug System.out from Jetty
    o Shutdown message is now correctly sent to all users again.
    o Fixed problem with "Could not find any usable authentication schemes"
      that would occur on the logon page under some circumstances.
    o Fixed bug where Active Directory setup would always fail because kerberos 
      implementation in the java runtime would still attempt to use 
      previously entered settings.
    o Fixed NPE that could sometimes occur when listing any resource 
      types. This could be caused by stray resource / policy relationship
      records pointing to resources that no longer exist. This error is
      now trapped and any invalid resources just hidden.
    o 'Cannot create wizard Sequence' errors should now no longer appear
      if an attempt is made to access a later wizard page before the first page
      is filled in. This could happen with incorrect bookmarks or if a
      session timed out whilst using the wizard. The user will now be 
      directed to the page before the wizard started, or failing that the
      home page. Also, if this occurs during the installation wizard, an
      additional message will be displayed.
    o Fixed problem where resources that were not allowed by policy were
      showing in the favorites page (although they could not be used).
    o Nested policies have been removed as they were broken. Is anyone using them?
    o Agent now sets proxy authentication as preemptive if authentication type is Basic  
    o POST parameter encoding fix applied to last release still had issues with some types
      of encoded parameters.
    o Launching of agent on startup directed user to incorrect page.
    o Active Directory accounts listing includes Computer accounts.
    o Redirect invalid hostname when multiple valid hosts exists was broken.
    o Changed the action name for reset user attributes to match the method name.
    
-----------------

SSL-Explorer 0.2.7_02 - August 14, 2006

Bug Fixes
    o Replacement proxy resources upgraded from 0.2.4 throw NullPointerException when an
      attempt is made to edit them.
                     
-----------------

SSL-Explorer 0.2.7_01 - August 12, 2006

Bug Fixes
    o Downloading files in IE was broken after Cache-Control, Expires and Pragma headers were added
      to the HTTP response.
    o LogonStateMachine is not re-initialized in all WebDAV & Embedded client flows. Causing NullPointerException 
      when client attempts to connect.
    o Removing child page task fails to remove reference from menu map.
    o Bug introduced in 0.2.5 caused certificates to fail import.
    o Reverse proxy fails to process POST parameters when Content-Type is not application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   
-----------------

SSL-Explorer 0.2.7 - August 7, 2006


Bug Fixes
    o Reverse proxy to Outlook Web Access corrupts POST parameters. This is caused by IIS
      and OWA assuming an ISO-8859-1 encoding and not setting this as the encoding on 
      the request. An addtional field has now been added allowing the default UTF-8 encoding
      to be overriden with the character set specified in the Reverse Proxy configuration.
    o Importing trusted certificate fails with NullPointerException. Alias is required
      but field was missing from user interface.
    o Importing trusted certificate fails when subject entity does not contain audited
      entity.
    o LogonStateMachine is not re-initialized in all logon flows. Causing NullPointerException 
      after server has restarted.
      
-----------------

SSL-Explorer 0.2.6 - August 4, 2006

Features
    o Login flow now presents user with the authentication schemes they have been assigned
      through their policy. If a user is not attached to any authentication schemes they
      will simply not be able to login. This requires that the user enter their username 
      before being passed through to the authentication scheme selection, if the user
      only has one scheme assigned they will be automatically be taken to that scheme. To
      prevent leakage of user information an attempt to login with a bad username will still
      result in an authentication scheme being dispayed.
    o Attribute selection user interface added to input fields where attributes can be set.
    o RSS based context sensitive help added to managment console.
                          
Bug Fixes
    o User is prompted for password if they attempt to access a resource that contains 
      the ${session:password} attribute and their chosen authentication scheme does not
      contain the password module.
    o Proxy support was broken since 0.1.16. This release contains fixes for agent proxy
      authentication.
    o Domain field missing from profile agent proxy information.
    
----------------
    
SSL-Explorer 0.2.5 - July 28, 2006

Features
    o Authentication schemes are now assigned to policies. This currently has no effect but has been 
      added in preperation for the next release that will include a policy based authentication flow.
    o Replacement proxy can now set list of acceptable target hosts, with wildcard support.
    o Authentication scheme order options added.
    o Policy order options added to resource assignment (in preperation for policy attributes).
                
Bug Fixes
    o Access to resources with ${session:password} was broken when Password module was not present 
      in the authenticated scheme. User will now be prompted for their password before being
      allowed access to the resource.
    o Confidential data private key flow breaks when Password module is not used in the authenticated
      scheme.
    o If ${session:username} and ${session:password} are used for web forward authentication but the 
      values are incorrect, the user is never able to authenticate through normal HTTP authentication.            
    o After a restart request the user interface becomes unusable.
    o Authentication options removed from tunneled web forward.
    o Deleting single file in Network Places now prompts user to confirm
    o Warning messages no longer displayed on logon page.

    o Extension types can now be added using sslexplorer.extenstionType.xxxx system property with 
      xxxx being the plugin type name and value pointing to a valid ExtensionType class name. 
    o Extensions can now be hidden from the application view with the hidden="true" attribute.
    o Agent launcher extended to allow other application types to be launched directly through the
      launcher applet.

Bug Fixes
    o Active directory searches now support paging of requests, this helps to support AD deployments
      where the number of objects exceeds the maximum page size (which by default is 1000).
    o Message sink fails to initialize a newly added sink after the Notifier has been started.
    o Network place stores now set default file encoding. CIFS store encoding can be changed at 
      runtime by setting the "jcifs.encoding=CHARSET" system property in $SSLX_HOME/sslexplorer/conf where
      CHARSET is the expected encoding of the CIFS servers.
    o Disabled authentication schemes were still able to be selected at logon.
    o Multiple groups of same type added to Active Directory users.
    o All ant targets now compile source code when invoked.
    o HTTPS reverse proxies would fail due to Maverick SSL trust store being unavailable in source release.
   
-----------------

SSL-Explorer 0.2.1 - June 15, 2006

Bug Fixes
    o UTF-8 encoding of web pages fails because reverse proxy 'bug' forces ISO-8859-1 encoding
      of requests.
    o PKCS12 import of server certificate fixed.
    o Fixed bug in Active Directory which caused pre-authentication information is invalid erros
      even when username and password is correct. This was traced back to case sensitivity option.
    o Usernames and passwords are encoded correctly into Network Places URIs.
    o Network places edit re-encodes and already encoded path.
    o All logging now wrapped into isInfoEnabled, isDebugEnabled methods to help reduce logging 
      overhead.
    o Web forwards on favourites page are now launched in seperate window.
    o Default logging level changed back to INFO.
    o Exception thrown when no extension store is available.    
    o Web folders fail to launch with NullPointerException thrown from getPasswordFromCredentials.
    o Active directory referrals cause multiple user database failures.
    o Sort fails on groups and account pages.
    o Proxy settings not used by installation wizard.    
    o Deleting/creating built-in accounts causes session to crash.

    o Text area parameter type causes JSP error.
    o Registry <get> extension element not recognised by server after extension upload. 

-----------------

SSL-Explorer 0.1.15 - January 20, 2006

Features
    o Reverse proxy host header field added - allows you to define the exact hostname used so
      that backend servers can be configured to use virtual hosting.
    o NTLM proxy support now allows a browser to transparently authenticate over NTLM against 
      a reverse proxy web forward.
    o Wake up on LAN feature allows broadcast packet to be sent to wakeup computers.

Bugs
    o Outgoing HTTP connections incorrectly forced to disconnect causing forwarding errors.
    o Upload of certificate authority reply fails with 404 Page Not Found error.
    o HTTP debugging mode in some cases causes 404 Page Not Found errors on web forwards.
    o VPN Client synchronization would often fail even though the client was started OK.
    o Active directory database fails to initialize when hostname contains '_' character.
    o Fix to trusted CA signature verification process which caused some certificates to be 
      incorrectly returned as invalid.
    o Editing a reverse proxy web forward fails to save with "Path already exists" error.
    o VPN client fails to connect with Handshake failure after installing CA trusted cert.

-----------------

SSL-Explorer 0.1.14 - October 27, 2005

Features
    o Optional HTTP listener can now redirect users to HTTPS server.
    o SSL tunneling now supports remote forwarding.
    o PKCS12 private keys can now be imported into SSL-Explorer's keystore.
     
Bugs

    o Secure proxy only supports GET and POST requests.
    o Extension ${session:password} token was not being replaced with users password.
    o HttpUrlConnection to extension store does not follow redirects.
    o Server start up check fails when server is configured to listen on a specific interface
      and another service exists on the same port on a different interface.   
    o Cannot create a secure proxy replacement setting.
    o Setting proxy type to 'None' causes VPN client launch failure. 
    o Launching native executable as an extension with a working directory set fails. Java
      exec method (on windows) is not searching the working directory for executables, only
      the path.
    o When using the 'Status' page to logoff embedded client sessions, any active
      tunnels were not being closed.

-----------------

SSL-Explorer 0.1.13_03 - September 27, 2005

Bugs 
    o Reverse proxy to HTTP services hosted on IIS often fail due to incorrect <base> tag. Added automatic
      detection of IIS to set "Front-End-Https: on" header, in addition Location headers are converted
      if host is same as SSL-Explorer server and protocol is http://
    o Strict checking does not list Windows 2000 and Windows 98 as supported operating systems, causing 
      client connection failures on those OS.

SSL-Explorer 0.1.13_02 - September 23, 2005

Bugs 
    o Corrected cookie expiry code to only require a cookie when HTTP session has closed, active
      HTTP sessions will still be usable if the browser fails to send the logon cookie with every
      request.
    o Disabling of password expiry was broken.
    o Forcing a password change when creating a user throws exception.

SSL-Explorer 0.1.13_01 - September 22, 2005

Bugs 
    o Global reverse proxy configurations do not work for ordinary users even if they
      have the necersary permissions.
    o Applications fail to launch through a proxy server
    o VPN client fails to register when 'valid hostnames' configuration has been set.
    o Launching an Active DNS reverse proxy will now evaluate the request host header
      and display an error if the browser is connected using a numeric IP address

SSL Explorer 0.1.13 - September 15, 2005

Features 
     o New web forward type "Reverse proxy" added. This behaves in much the 
       same was as the Apache reverse proxy feature. Web forwards are forwarded
       based upon the path element of the URL. For example to forward OWA you would
       forward all paths begining with '/exchange', '/exchweb' and '/public'.
     o Full support for IE OWA interface through the reverse proxy feature.
     o Reverse proxy also supports an 'Active DNS' feature which allows web sites
       running on the root of a web server to be forwarded through the reverse proxy. For
       example under normal conditions you would not be able to forward a site for which
       the entry URL is 'http://www.example.com/" because there are no paths to match with
       reverse proxy rules. This feature requires that a wildcard CNAME DNS record points
       to the SSL-Explorer server.
     o The proxy URL option has been removed and replaced with 5 separate
       fields. Upon upgrade any previous proxy URL will be removed and will
       have to be re-applied manually. Better detection of browser settings
     o Added documentation link to the 3sp.com knowledge base
     o A new option 'Validate external hostnames' has been added to 
       "Admin -> Configuration -> Gemeral Options" that checks the hostname 
       as entered in the browser. If the hostname is not in the list (one host 
       per line), then the browser will be directed to the first in the list (the 
       default).
     o Boolean parameter type in extension.xml now supports typeMeta attribute which 
       enables values other than 'true' or 'false' to be used.
     o Roles and accounts pages are now paged and sorted with the ability to changed 
       the number of items shown on a single page.
     o Active Directory configuration improvements - A standard configuration will now list
       all accounts and roles within unless any number of OU filters are setup. If filters
       exist then only the accounts and roles within or beneath the filtered OUs will be
       shown.
     o AD OU filter will now automatically append the base DN if required, for example if
       you had 'OU=Employees,DC=EXAMPLE,DC=COM' you can now omit 'DC=Example,DC=COM' and enter
       the value 'OU=Employees'

Bugs 
     o IE + Firefox will no longer ask if you want to store a new password
       even when there is no valid logon password on the page.
     o If an exception page is displayed during the logon sequence, the browser
       no longer shows any fields entered (username, password etc) in the 
       address bar upon clicking close.
     o Deleting a profile fails.
     o Changing password allows use of old password.
     o Secure proxy allows URL's to be entered manually. This was a potential security 
       problem as users could navigate to any URL through the secure proxy feature.
     o When attempting to launch the VPN client and a Java runtime is not available, if 
       the user chooses not to download the plugin (or is not given the option to) - 
       there was no way of escaping the launch page.
     o Using the MS JVM for the VPN client now works again (you will no longer be forced 
       to download the Sun JRE). Only If NO Java is installed, you will still be instructed 
       the Sun runtime.
     o Attempting to launch a HTML application before the VPN client is loaded fails.
     o When an existing keystore had an incorrect password, setting the password to the 
       correct value did not load the keystore until the service was restarted. The keystore 
       is now reloaded whenever the password is changed.
     o Setup fails to start with incorrect AD settings. This is actually caused by the server
       closing the main thread down after 30 seconds, the AD database was still attempting to 
       contact the domain server and so initialization was not compelte. The timeout has now 
       been increased.
     o When manually uploading an extension as a default administrator, the upload would fail 
       the first time with 'permission denied ...'.

    
Additional Notes

     o Any web forward favorites will be DELETED upon upgrade. This is due
       to a change in the way these favorites are keyed in the database. 
     o More JSP files have being renamed to the correct .JSPF (JSP Fragment).
       This helps with syntax checking in IDEs.
     o Major re-factoring, and package re-organisation. SSL-Explorer is now
       split up into more jars as well.
     o The system property sslexplorer.useDevConfig previously also enabled the
       TCP/IP database server. This must now be done separately using the
       sslexplorer.hsqldb.tcpipServer property.

-----------------

SSL Explorer 0.1.12 - June 30, 2005

Features
     o Installation of service scripts should now work correctly on Debian based systems
       (tested on Ubuntu 5.04).
     o The improved menus from the SSL-Explorer Xtra Extension has been moved 
       into the GPL core. The menus have also been re-organised.
     o Improvements to VPN client launching. It may now be launched or shutdown 
       by clicking on the ONLINE / OFFLINE status at the top of the page. The launching 
       itself is now done on a separate page which then redirects back to the previous page 
       when complete.
     o SSL-Explorer now has a much more flexible Authentication Module features. The user 
       may define their own 'Authentication Schemes'. Each scheme may then be customised 
       to consist of any available 'Authentication Modules' (with one scheme being flagged 
       as the Default). When logging on, the user may then choose which scheme to use and 
       they will be presented with each module one by one until completely logged on. 
     o Personal Information authentication scheme added to provide a second level of authentication
     o When using Active Directory, SSL-Explorer now requires a 'Service Account Username' 
       and 'Service Account Password'. These should be the logon details of a dedicated account 
       that you must set up in your Active Directory. Once this has been configured, you will 
       be able to view roles and accounts (including in setup mode).
     o It is no longer necessary to restart the server when you change the Active Directory 
       configuration. 

Bugs
     o An 'Exit' button is now available when the browser is restarted and session locking
       is turned on. This allows you to logoff.
     o Embedded VPN client failed to authenticate to 0.1.11. 
     o Embedded client disconnect method fails to stop any listening sockets that have been opened.        

Additional Notes

     o Many JSP files are gradually being renamed to the correct JSPF (JSP Fragment).
       This helps with syntax checking in IDEs.

=================

SSL Explorer 0.1.11 - May 27, 2005

Features
     o Status page is now available which shows the currently logged on users and their
       remote ip providing the administrator with the ability to logoff sessions.
     o SSL-Explorer can now check whether there are any updates to the core
       available, or if there any extensions installed that have updates. These
       features will be automatically enabled if you accept the agreement to 
       connect to the 3SP Extension Store. You may also enable this manually
       in Setup -> General Configuration -> Automatic Updates.
     o Documentation can now be reached from the new 'Help' menu. The Guides 
       have been moved out of the installer archives and into the webapp/doc.

Bugs
     o 'Shutdown' button on shutdown page renamed to 'Ok'. 
     o VPN client sessions will now correctly be timed out if the VPN client
       dies unexpectedly. 
     o VPN client launcher uses java system property "user.home" to determine where to install
       downloaded applications. Under the Microsoft VM this property is set to "C:\Windows\Java"
       yet under Sun VM it points to the users profile directory. An attempt is now made to determine
       the users profile directory and use it under the Microsoft VM. 
       
SSL Explorer 0.1.10 - May 13, 2005

Features
     o Experimental service support for SuSE Linux. Thanks jooa.
     o New 'About' page and SSL-Explorer logo
     o Administrative warnings - New global warnings features that is used to provided administrative 
       warnings when certain configuration changes occur. A message requesting a restart is displayed 
       under the following conditions:-

             1. Key store / certificates change.
             2. User database changes.
             3. Default administrators changes.
             4. Active Directory configuration changes
             5. CIFS configuration changes

     o Shutdown warning when other users are logged on - Message is now displayed telling the admin 
       how many users are currently logged on when either Shutting down / Restarting using the web interface.
     o Application shortcuts cancel button required has been added to most forms where appropriate. You will
       be taken back to the previous page.
     o Minor Enhanchment to Prompt Profile at Login - If 'Prompt for profile at logon' is enabled, the profile 
       is no longer prompted for if the user only has one available.
     o A Warning is now displayed on the logon page if cookies are not enabled on a users browser. SSL-Explorer 
       relies on cookies and will act very strangely if they are not available.
     o Global profiles are now uneditable

Bug Fixes
     o Blank page displays after completing form input - This is caused by the browser failing to redirect from
       the VPN client to the SSL-Explorer server. The redirected link is now displayed so that the user can 
       navigate to the correct location instead of using the browsers back button.
     o Opening documents in network places HTML directory browser now spawns a new window.
     o Manually uploading new extension (application) bundles failed when using IE.
     o Refresh now works correctly in the network places HTML file browser when using Internet Explorer.
     o Active Directory users with no roles are no longer displayed in the account list.
     o Fixed bug where it was possible for a user to edit a few global properties in the 'Options' page of the 
       HTML network places browser. 'Options' will now no longer be available if the current profile is a global one.
     o Users that were part of a revoked role that had adminstrator permission were still able to logon. Also, it was
       possible to grant / revoke default administrator roles. This had no meaning as all default administrator users
       and roles are granted access.
     o OWA doesn't like percentage characters - This was part of a larger form encoding problem when the form in 
       question is sent as a GET request and was being decoded twice.
     o Network places not responding - More friendly error message displayed if SSL-Explorer (jCIFS) cannot locate 
       the windows master browser.
     o Fixed possible NPE with some Active Directory configurations.
     o Java RDP not using specified username - Java RDP application was not using the specified username / password.
     o Fixed problem where IE would not always show that the VPN client had successfully been started (it was showing
       the 'Launch' button).
     o Fixed bug where replacement type could not be changed (e.g. from 'Received Content' to 'Sent Header'
     o Fixed more encoding problems in Secure Proxy Web Forwards.
     o Fixed incorrect warning text for profile deletion.

-----------------

SSL Explorer 0.1.9 - April 5, 2005

Features
     o Improvide application shortcuts UI. Application description is now
       shown when creating a shortcut.
     o New option for secure proxy webforwards to try the current username / 
       password credentials if a HTTP authentication is requested. 
     o Option to request that a user changes their password upon next logon
       (for user databases that support password change). The default 'admin' 
       user will also now require changing upon initial logon.
     o Account deletion now requires confirmation.
     o Improvements to server lock detection (the sslexplorer.run problem for
       those that experienced it). More meaningful error messages are also
       now given when there are port conflicts.
     o Cancel buttons have been added to most forms where appropriate. You
       will be taken back to the previous page.
     o Property help is now shown as a tool tip.
     o Option to view network place in Microsoft WebFolders view
      
Bug Fixes
     o Autocompletion for passwords in shortcuts was enabled.
     o Profile being edited was being made the current profile upon applying
       new properties.
     o Obsolete user information was being left behind when accounts were 
       deleted. This is now cleaned up (Currently JDBC user database only).
     o Use of % characters when submitting forms using GET via secure proxy 
       webforwards was failing.
     o Opening documents in network places HTML directory browser now spawns
       a new window.
     o When 'Prompt for profile at logon' is enabled, the profile selector was
       displayed when only one profile was available. 

-----------------   

SSL Explorer 0.1.8 - March 14, 2005
    
Features
     o Domain, user and password are can now be made optional for the rdesktop
       and Java RDP applications.
     o New option for VPN client 'No session timeout if active' that will 
       prevent SSL-Explorer timing-out the session if the VPN client is active.
     o Session time-out can now be set per profile instead of globally. This
       allows for example a lower timeout to be configured for profiles that
       may be used on public machines.
     o Web Forward URLs may now be edited.
     o Application resources are now installed to 
       [install]/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/[pkg]/ApplicationResources.properties.
       This will also for easier internationalisation and customisation. 
     o New permissions framework. See documentation for more details. Note,
       the user enable / disable and administrator flags are now presented
       as permissions. You may also have to change your list of default
       administrators (now in the Setup -> General -> Security) and disable 
       any users you may have previously disabled.
     o Support added in Web forwarding for MS Outlook Web Access.
     o Active directory user information is now cached. This is backed up
       by a new option (User / Group details cache TTL)
     o New option to place restrictions on logging on multiple times. Can
       either be restricted to single session per user, or a single session
       per user / ip address (i.e. the same username may logon from the 
       same host many times).
     o New option to disable automatic connection to 3SP application store.
     o A single application descriptor may now contain many application 
       definitions, as demonstrated in the RMAS suite.
     o Performance improvements to the secure proxy. 
     o Web forwards, Network places and SSL Tunnels may now all be added 
       as favorites. The home page has been reworked to display these 
       different categories of favorites.

Bug Fixes
     o Built in users could not be created or edited in setup mode.
     o Keystore password removed from Setup -> General Configuration ->
       Web Server. This is now must be changed in the Setup -> Ceritificates.
     o Roles with international characters in their names could not be deleted.
     o Problem with secure proxy and sites that check the referer header.
     o Classloader problems causing critical errors in accounts setup.
     o Favourites on the welcome page were completely broken.
     o Checking of password policy was being done for user databases that
       dont support password change (i.e. AD). This caused a conflict as
       AD has its own password policies. Password policies are now ignored
       if the underlying database doesnt support password change.
     o Performance improvements for listing of AD users.
     o Change the auto-start flag on existing tunnels was broken.
     o Profile selection no longer displays menu items and tabs that cannot
       be used until a profile is selected.
     o On Windows, when SSL Explorer is launched from a shortcut (either 
       setup mode or console), any start-up errors will be displayed in 
       a dialog instead of the console that rapidly disappears!
     o Secure proxy now support file uploads.
     o New 'Bind address' option to set what interface to listen for browser 
       connections on. Blank or 0.0.0.0 may be used to listen on all interfaces. 
       This returns functionality removed when we stopped using the XML for 
       Jetty configuration (jetty.xml).
     o VPN client fails to tunnel with proxy connection. Added new code to resolve
       this and added NTLM authentication (tested against ISA server) and
       digest authentication (experimental may not work)
      
-----------------   

SSL Explorer 0.1.7 - January 28, 2005

Features
     o Session timeout may now be configured.
     o Application shortcuts may be edited.
     o Global application shortcuts may now be defined. 
     o Many changes to the format of application.xml have been made. More details
       will be made available in the documentation.
     o New Application Store management features including download applications
       from the new 3SP Application Store. 
     o Embedded clients now supports authentication via a ticket. This allows
       SSL Explorer aware applications to be defined and launched without 
       authenticating again.
     o VPN client now has a console where all log output can be monitored.
     o New 'HTML' application bundle type allowing Applets and ActiveX 
       components to be deployed. The same features that are available for
       Java applications are available, including tunnels and embedded client
       ticket authentication.
     o Added tunnel inactivity timeout (defaults to 10 minutes). 
     o If SSL Explorer is running on a network where it is required (or useful)
       to use a proxy server for outgoing connections, both HTTP and SOCKS 
       servers may now be configured.
     o Tunnels can now be edited (both personal and global).
     o New options to 'Try current user' and 'Try guest' for authentication in
       Network Places (both HTML and WebDAV).
     o Option to prevent application tunnels being started on the
       preferred port. Add the attribute 'usePreferredPort' and set a value of false.
     o New screens to create, edit and delete replacement patterns used to process
       pages loaded through the secure proxy feature.
     o New feature to check the VPN clients environment (Os name, version, patch level and
       Java version and vendor). The feature must be enabled in the Setup -> General 
       then a new setup section will appear allowing you to configure the restrictions.
     o Progress bar shows slightly (!) more accurate progress.
     

Bug Fixes
     o Sessions will no longer timeout during webdav operations or if tunnels are open.
     o Uploaded files were being saved to memory first making it impossible to
       upload large files.
     o Robots.txt added to prevent search engines finding SSL Explorer installations.
     o Some Windows Networks would not allow access (when a host was not part of a domain).
     o Password / Security options are back again, this time in Setup -> General
     o Username / Password will no longer be remembered by the browser at the login screen.
     o Bookmarks now work in web pages loaded through the secure proxy.

      the application in. The 'dir' attribute can be added to the <main> element.
      Use %INSTALLDIR% to specify the directory where the application files are
      downloaded to.
    o Added the Java IRC client PJIRC as a supported application.
    o Accounts tab moved to 'Admin.' section.
    o IP Restrictions moved to 'Setup' section.
    o User logon information is now displayed in the footer.
    o Support for launching VPN client through HTTP proxy
